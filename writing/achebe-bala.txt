Interviews are one of my favorite things to read or watch online ...and boy I've consumed sooo many. Last Sunday however, I helped produce one for Accra Atheists(AA). AA's Reason Rising interview and discussion series is an initiative of Rosyln Mould, Founder & President of Accra Atheists and Vice President of Humanists International(HI).

Before Roslyn announced the list of potential interviewees I'd never heard of Mubarak Bala and his struggles as a humanist breaking free from Islamic traditions that has held his family together for decades if not centuries in Northern Nigeria. However, a Ghanaian interviewing a Nigerian with themes of tradition, religion and exile reminded me of philosopher Kwame Anthony Appiah's interview of the Nigerian literary giant Chinua Achebe 13 years ago. 

There are interesting parallels and contrasts in Achebe and Bala's accounts, both outsiders and insiders at the same time, of Igbo and Hausa cultures in Nigeria. I highly recommend watching them as a double to uncover the echoes in time for yourself.
